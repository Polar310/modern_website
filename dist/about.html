                    I'm a 2nd-year Software Engineering bachelor, who is currently exploring roles
                    that will guide me to become ardently versatile in the realm of software development or in Venture
                    Capital.
                    My areas of interest are Product management/ analysis, Fintech, AI, ML, Blockchain, & Backend
                    development.
                    I have a good knowledge of technology and in focus of how AI & ML are changing the
                    landscape (application wise as well), also
                    Renewable energy
                    (Hydrogen, Ammonia, CCS).

                    Having been born to a family of entrepreneurs, and worked on a profusuion of startups has resulted
                    in this desire of Entrepreneurship to be forged into me, I have therefore developed a knack for
                    deciphering
                    at an early stage the kind of businesses that work and are succesful, and hence have decided to work
                    in the
                    field of Venture Capital.


                    I would like to gain more experience and knowledge with the same grit but with a passion upon given
                    opportunities
                    and possibilities.

                    Got the opportunity to be involved with two major projects valued
                    at over $500 million focusing on engineering and economics.
                    my experience encompassed renewable energy, carbon emissions, and manufacturing processes,
                    resulting in valuable research outputs and insights into successful business operations.
                    This opportunity helped me in developing a newfound interest in renewable energy and trading.

                    During my internship I conducted research on health and financial insurance data, developing
                    financial
                    models for potential insurance plans. Additionally, I crafted a life and finance insurance plan and
                    formulated an effective financial strategy that led to customer acquisition and resulted in a
                    successful sale.
