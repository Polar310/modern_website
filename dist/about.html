                    <!-- need to change later  -->
                    I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science bachelor, who is currently exploring roles 
                    that will guide me to become ardently versatile in the realm of software development.
                    My areas of interest are Fintech, AI, ML, Blockchain, & Backend development. 
                    Mid-way through my Electrical Engineering degree I realised I had no passion for 
                    electrical engineering and made a decision to switch to something I'm more passionate about. 
                    
                    Most would say why did it take me 3 years to realise this? 
                    Conversely, it was a struggle to give up because I wanted to put in my best efforts. I would like to 
                    gain more experience and knowledge with the same grit but with a passion upon given opportunities and possibilities.

                <p> 
                     Through my experience with 11point2, I developed a deep understanding of Hydrogen, Ammonia, 
                     Wind & Solar energy, Carbon capture and emissions. 
                     Understood about the engineering, manufacturing, economics (including financial), and the 
                     trades related to it. 
                     This opportunity helped me in developing a newfound interest.

                    Learnt about the insurance industry, specifically on health and finances. 
                    I learnt how to create insurance plans and pitched a successful sale. 
                    Although not my domain, but I was curious about this industry and wanted to venture 
                    into it deeper.
