                    <!-- need to change later  -->
                    I'm a 2nd year Computer Science bachelor, who is currently exploring roles 
                    which will aid me to become more well rounded in the realm of software development,
                    I'm keen in fintech, AI, ML, blockchain, & backend development. 

                    I was studying an electrical engineering degree before this and I was in my 3rd year.
                    I realised I had no passion for electrical engineering and made a decision to switch into 
                    something I'm more passionate about. 
                    
                    some say why did I spend 3 years to realise this? 
                    I say it was hard to give up because I wanted to give my best efforts. I would like to 
                    gain more experience and knowledge with the same grit but with a passion upon given opportunities.

                <p> 
                     Through my experience with 11point2, I developed a deep understanding on Hydrogen, Ammonia, 
                     Wind & Solar energy, Carbon capture and emissions. 
                     Understood about the engineering, manufacturing, economics (including financial), and the 
                     Trades of it. 
                     This opportunity helped me in developing an interest and in these industries and made me keep 
                     up to date with.

                    Learnt about the insurance industry, specifically on health and financial. 
                    I learnt how to create insurance plans and pitched a successful sale. 
                    Although not my domain, but I was curious about this industry and wanted to venture 
                    into it deeper.
